A WebExtensions addon which adds a Wayback Machine option in the context (right-click) menu.
There are currently three options: 
    Go to the latest archived version, 
    go to the oldestt, or 
    search for any versions.

The addon should work in Firefox >= 48.0, Chrome and Opera, although I've not
tried it on opera yet..
